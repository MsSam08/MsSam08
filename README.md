## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate Cloud Data Engineer with a strong background in data science, cloud infrastructure, and environmental analytics. My work blends scalable engineering with insightful analytics — often with a focus on hydrological systems and climate data.

I specialize in designing cloud-native data pipelines and dashboards that turn raw data into actionable intelligence. I enjoy working across the stack — from ingestion and modeling to visualization and deployment.
